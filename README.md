## Introduction

The test_2023_05_24 repository serves as a sandbox for testing and experimentation. It includes a script that processes a log file and generates a report of the users, the number of sessions, and the minimum possible total duration of their sessions in seconds. The purpose of this script is to analyze the log data and provide valuable insights.

## Installation

## Usage

To run the script and generate the report, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a log file containing the necessary data.

2. Open the script file, `log_parser.py`, in a text editor.

3. Modify the script to provide the correct path to your log file. You can usually find this information in the code comments or at the beginning of the script.

4. Save the modified script.

5. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.

6. Run the script using the Python interpreter:
   ```
   python log_parser.py
   ```

7. The script will process the log file and generate a report with the users, the number of sessions, and the minimum possible total duration of their sessions in seconds. The report will be printed to the console.
